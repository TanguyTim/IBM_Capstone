# Presentation of the data
To build our model we'll use historical car accident casualtiesâ€™ data available on data.gov.be. This data are available on an annual basis for every year between 2005 and 2019. This data includes only the accidents with casualties expressed as "slightly injured", "severely injured" and/or "death" as well as the number of victims of each type for each accident. The dataset also contains various information about the accidents like:
- Date, day of the week and time
- Lighting conditions (day, sunrise/sunset, night with public lighting and night without public lighting)
- Location of the accident (address), type of neighbourhood (inside or outside city) and type of road (local, regional or highway)
- Identity of the victim (age category and sex) and type (driver, passenger, pedestrian, cyclist)
- Type of vehicle involved
Unfortunately some potentially intersecting features are missing. More details about weather conditions could be useful (rain, frost, snow,) but are not directly available. This information could however be reconstructed using historical weather data publically available from weather data provider using date, time and location of each accident (e.g. from https://dev.meteostat.net/). Other missing information like was speeding, alcohol or drugs involved will probably be difficult to reconstruct. Age, time and day of the week of the accident could give us proxies of this but we probably need new dataset including these features to properly account for these aspects.
