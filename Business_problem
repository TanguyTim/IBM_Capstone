# Introduction to the business problem
Car accidents are one of the major causes of death nowadays. Being able to better understand what causes them could greatly help reduce the number of accident and save lives. In this project we will build models and algorithms to try and predict what are the main causes for road accidents and more specifically predict the severity of said accident in term injuries or death of people involved.
In this project we'll mainly focused of accidents occurring in Belgium between 2015 and 2019. The results could help various stakeholders:
- Help roads users (drivers, cyclist, pedestrians,) better understand factors that increase the risk of accident and adapt their behaviour accordingly.
- Help road safety agencies design awareness campaigns focusing on the most appropriate message
- Help emergency services better anticipate when sever accident are likely to occur to size response teams accordingly
Other more long term potentials could be considered like guiding the development of new or improved safety features in vehicles or on roads. Such algorithms could also help autonomous vehicles identify risky conditions and adapt the driving behaviour accordingly.
